# Technologies Used
This game was created using Javascript, HTML and CSS

The cards were generated using a CSS file that was provided to me, under cardstarter.css

# Getting Started
You can play the game [here](https://donaldadams-sellin.github.io/Blackjack/).
In this version, as in most, the dealer must hit on 16 and under, and must stand on 17 or greater. You can split a hand once on equal value cards. If you aren't familiar with Blackjack rules- The goal is to have a higher hand value than the dealer, without going over 21, cards count for face value, with jack, queen and kings counting as 10. Aces can count for 11, or 1 if they would make the hand go over 21. You get dealt 2 cards to start, and can 'hit' to be dealt another card, or stand to cease getting cards and letting the dealers turn to progress. An initial hand of 21 is an automatic win, unless the dealer also gets 21. If the dealer gets an initial hand of 21 and you do not, it is an automatic loss.

# Next Steps
Adding in some animations or sounds would likely be the next step in improving the polish of the game. Additionally being able to further split hands after the first would be an improvement I would like to add, as at many places where the game is played it is allowable to split more than once.
