#   Blackjack
This is a fairly straightforward blackjack game, as can be found in many casinos

# Screenshots

# Technologies Used
This game was created using Javascript, HTML and CSS

The cards were generated using a CSS file that was provided to me, under cardstarter.css

# Getting Started
You can play the game [here](https://donaldadams-sellin.github.io/Blackjack/).
In this version, as in most, the dealer must hit on 16 and under, and must stand on 17 or greater. You can split a hand once on equal value cards
